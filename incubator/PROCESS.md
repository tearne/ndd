# Process

Two modes: **plan** and **build**. Each change moves through a fixed sequence with explicit user gates.


## Modes

**Plan mode** — research, reason, produce a change document. Read any project file. Write only to `changes/`. Negotiate structure and approach with the user through a drafted document and an Unresolved list of open items.

**Build mode** — execute an approved plan. Write to project files. Follow the plan; don't redesign. If the plan turns out to be wrong, stop and hand back to the user for direction rather than improvising. The user may choose to rework the plan, but it must stay active if code has been changed.


## Plan mode

A change document is a single markdown file in `changes/open/`. Directly under the title, a `**Mode:** <name>` line records the mode (see Modes below).

Each stage is drafted into the change document, then surfaced for approval. Chat carries disclosures (notably Unresolved) and summaries, not the draft itself.

If a `map.md` exists, it is the primary frame of reference. Describe the change in terms of the map's concepts and boundaries — not source files, not code structure. Tasks that affect mapped concepts reference the map node, not the implementing file.

### Seeds

A change may begin life as a **seed** — a captured thought not yet worked, held as the minimal head of a change document. A seed's head carries a title, a `**Kind:**` line (`todo` for committed work, `idea` for a candidate to weigh), and an `**Anchor:**` line (the stable ID of the map node it concerns; see `MAP-GUIDANCE.md`), plus a line or two of text — but no `**Mode:**`. It lives in `changes/open/` alongside worked changes, captured frictionlessly via `aside:` (see `KEYWORDS.md`), so there is a single place to look for everything pending.

A seed and the change it becomes are one lineage. When a seed is picked up to be worked, it **matures in place**: the same file's `**Kind:**` line gives way to a `**Mode:**` line and it gains an Intent — the seed text is the Intent's germ — then proceeds through the normal stages. No new file and no move; the seed's anchor keeps the resulting change located on the map.

### Modes

A change runs in one of three modes. After Intent is approved, the agent proposes one (default Formal) and the user confirms.

- **Formal** — Intent → Approach → Plan-as-tasks → Build → Conclusion. The default; the heavyweight cadence for work that benefits from explicit decisions and an executable checklist.
- **Explore** — same gates as Formal, but the Plan is topics + done-when rather than tasks. For work where depth and coverage matter more than a fixed step list.
- **Wander** — Intent → Build → retrospective Conclusion. No Approach, no Plan. When the agent detects a topic shift, it reminds the user a Wander change is open and may offer to flush. Discarded Wander changes are deleted (no archive). The change name may be updated to reflect where the work ended up.

Mode can be changed mid-flight: the user pauses, the change document is rewritten into the target mode's shape, and work resumes.

### Section length triggers

If a section exceeds its threshold, the agent doesn't surface it as final. It flags borderline content — significant material that might get cut but isn't essential — and asks the user to adjudicate. Tables and diagrams are excluded from the count.

| Section    | Threshold |
|------------|-----------|
| Intent     | 500       |
| Approach   | 1000      |
| Conclusion | 500 (Wander: 1000) |

Plan has no threshold; the Plan prune rules cover it.

### Intent

Why the change is needed. Domain language — what the user wants, not how the agent will do it. Brief. Ask the user to approve before continuing.

### Approach

(Formal and Explore only — Wander skips this stage.)

How the change will be implemented. Read the codebase. If a map exists, read it to understand the affected area and identify coverage gaps. Map edits are handled per `MAP-GUIDANCE.md`. Stale catch-ups (bringing the map in line with existing code) remain permitted at any time.

Once Intent is approved, the agent writes the Approach into the change document. Treat it as a list of decisions and their reasons, not a narrative:

- One subsection per decision; self-evident choices don't need a subsection.
- State the decision, then the reason in a sentence or two. Stop.
- Don't recap the Intent. Don't rehearse code structure or file-by-file steps — those belong in the Plan.
- When a decision is fully carried by a proposed map node update, don't restate it in prose — the node is the decision. Prose is for decisions that aren't in a node, or for the "why" the node can't convey.
- If a subsection can be deleted without losing a decision, delete it.

Before surfacing, the agent re-reads its own draft and removes anything that doesn't carry a decision-and-reason: recap of Intent, file-by-file rehearsal, hedging, restating choices already in proposed map nodes. Each line either carries a decision-and-reason or comes out. Only the post-prune draft is surfaced. The Section length triggers rule then applies.

Alongside the Approach, the agent writes an **Unresolved** section at the end of the document — a short bulleted list of the items the agent cannot settle alone, each pointing to the part of the Approach it affects.

After writing, the agent discloses the Unresolved list in chat so the user can answer immediately without opening the file. The user reviews the draft and answers the items (inline reply is fine). The agent folds the answers back into the Approach prose and removes resolved items from the list. When the list is empty, the Approach is ready for the user's explicit approval.

The Unresolved section is deleted once the Plan is written — its absence signals that the Approach is settled.

### Plan

The Plan describes what Build executes. The shape is set by mode:

- **Formal — Tasks.** Discrete checklist items, rendered as `- [ ] do thing` and ticked as completed.
- **Explore — Topics + done-when.** A bulleted list under **Topics**, followed by a **Done when** line naming completion. No tick boxes.

Wander has no Plan stage.

Plan prune rules:

- One task per atomic outcome.
- No "why" — that's the Approach's job.
- No obvious sub-steps.
- No ceremony tasks ("review", "double-check") without a real gate.
- Don't restate file paths the task name already implies.

Before surfacing the Plan, the agent re-reads it and applies these rules.


## Build mode

For projects with versioning, on entering Build the agent proposes a bump kind (major/minor/patch or date-based equivalent) against the current latest version, asks the user to approve, and writes it. Every subsequent hand-back to the user for testing bumps patch — initial completion or any later tweak — so the user can tell at a glance whether they are seeing the latest build. The final tested value is what ships, recorded in a single changelog entry. Conclusion confirms or revises the bump kind if scope shifted.

### Entering build

On approval to enter Build (Plan approval for Formal/Explore, Intent approval for Wander), create `changes/open/active.md` containing the filename of the change (e.g. `tighten-agent-instructions.md`, with no path prefix). This is the lock — only one change builds at a time. If `active.md` already exists, stop and tell the user. An agent resuming an interrupted build reads the change document itself to find the next unticked task.

### Log

During build, the agent maintains a running **Log** at the bottom of the change document — a bulleted list of the unexpected. Surprises, blockers, deviations, partial progress, or anything worth remembering between sessions that the ticked plan tasks don't already convey. Routine execution going to plan does not need logging.

Most recent entry at the bottom; one or two sentences each. The agent adds to the Log without user prompting.

The Log is working memory, not a signal that the plan turned out wrong. It is preserved when the change is archived — the archive is the complete record.

### Executing

Follow the Plan. Where it has tasks, work through them in order, ticking each in the change document as it completes. Where it has topics, work them toward the done-when condition. Don't redesign mid-build.

Post concise progress updates on screen as the work proceeds, but do not pause for interaction task by task. Only interact mid-build when something warrants it: surprises, ambiguity, or a plan problem.

Minor surprises — unexpected details that don't break the plan — go in the Log, and the build continues.

If the plan is wrong or incomplete and the path forward is unclear: stop, note the blocker in the Log, tell the user. Remove `active.md` only if no code has been changed; if the build left code half-finished the change stays active.

### Feedback

Feedback is written only after the user has agreed that the plan needs revisiting. The agent drafts it from the Log plus the user's direction. It has three parts:

- **Status:** implemented / partially implemented / not implemented
- **Notes:** what came up, what's unclear, and — for partial or not implemented — what the planner should reconsider
- **Documentation impact:** any project documents that may need review (e.g. map, spec, README)

Markers:

- Conclusion present → change is done.
- Feedback present without Conclusion → change is back in plan mode, awaiting replanning.

### Completing

When all plan tasks are done, tell the user and ask them to review. The Log is the record the user reads; highlight anything notable in chat. If the build affected mapped concepts, flag whether the map needs catching up. Do not write the Conclusion yet.

On the user's confirmation that the build is done, draft the Conclusion. It comments only on what isn't already captured — deviations, docs touched, or surprises. If nothing new, "Completed." suffices. For substantive changes to projects with a changelog, the draft also proposes an entry (see `ADDITIONAL/CHANGELOG.md`).

For Wander, the Conclusion is retrospective and captures the approach itself — there was no Approach stage to record it. The change name is updated if the work ended up somewhere different from the Intent.

Surface the draft for approval. On approval:

- If a changelog entry was approved, add it to the project's changelog.
- Move the change file to `changes/archive/` (prefixed `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`).
- Remove `active.md`.


## Gates and permissions

**Approval** — only valid when the user gives a clear affirmative in direct response to the agent asking — e.g. "approved", "yes", "y", "ok", "go ahead", "sounds good". Silence, ambiguity, or tangential replies are not approval; neither is a message that raises new questions or concerns.

**Write permissions**
- Plan mode: write only to `changes/`. Reading any project file is always permitted.
- Build mode: write to project files and `changes/`.

**Git** — write operations (commit, push, branch) require explicit user instruction. Never commit or push on own initiative.
