# Guidance for Writing Maps

Working principles for building conceptual maps of software systems. Emerging from practice — expect these to evolve.


## Structure: a tree of nodes

A map is a tree. Each node is a `#` heading followed by navigation links, prose, and optional sections. The tree structure is encoded in the links, not in the filesystem or heading hierarchy.

A rendered tree overview at the top of the map file aids orientation — keep it in sync with the nodes below. Use box-drawing characters in a fenced code block:

```
Application
├ Deck
│ ├ Waveform Colour
│ ├ Detail Waveform
│ │ ├ Wide Buffer
│ │ └ Sliding Viewport
│ └ Transport
├ Browser (TODO)
└ Settings (TODO)
```

Mark unmapped nodes with `(TODO)`. Place the tree at the end of the root node, after its prose.

### Node format

```markdown
# Node Name

[Parent Name](#parent)
[Child One](#child-one)
[Child Two](#child-two)

Terse conceptual description. Lead with the mental picture.

> [!IMPORTANT] callout for a load-bearing point the reader should not skim.

**Detail**

Implementation-level precision — parameters, thresholds, protocols.
The user can stop reading before this; the agent reads through it.

**See also**

- [Other Node](#other-node) — why the relationship matters
```

### Navigation links

Each node carries markdown links encoding its position in the tree:

- `[Parent Name](#parent)` — one link to the parent. Omitted only for the root node.
- `[Child Name](#child)` — one link per child.
- Links use the actual node name as the link text, not a generic `Up`/`Down` label.
- Links are standard markdown anchors, navigable with `gd` in editors with a markdown LSP (marksman recommended).
- To see a node's siblings, follow the parent link — the parent's child links show them all.

### Who maintains what

- **The user maintains the content** — prose, decisions, assumptions, and conceptual relationships (what is a child of what).
- **The agent maintains the navigation links** and flags inconsistencies.

### Node sections

All optional. Always in this order when present:

- **Prose** — terse conceptual description, leads with the mental picture. This is what the user reads.
- **Callouts** — `[!IMPORTANT]` for load-bearing points where skimming would lose the reader: design trade-offs, non-obvious assumptions, constraints that shape the whole node. The prose carries the semantic load (words like "assume", "decided", "never"); the callout just marks "don't skim this". Not for every notable fact.
- **Detail** — implementation-level precision (parameters, thresholds, algorithms). The user can stop reading before this. Marked with bold `**Detail**`.
- **See also** — cross-cutting references that aren't parent/child. Marked with bold `**See also**`. Each entry says why the relationship matters.


## Node sizing

Aim for under ~800 characters per node. The real test: if a node feels like it warrants sub-sections, it's too big — split into children. Flag nodes that exceed this to the user.


## The only-child rule

If a node would have no siblings and no children, it's not a node — it's the bottom of its parent.


## Content principles

- Lead with the mental picture, not the implementation.
- Name the boxes before explaining them ("three mechanisms: A, B, C" — then a node each).
- Not code-structure-coupled — may discuss technical concepts when load-bearing, but should not mirror module structure, reference function names, or break on refactor.
- Use continuous lines (no hard wraps mid-sentence) for soft-wrap compatibility.
- Blank line between bullet points for readability.


## File organisation

The format is agnostic about how nodes are distributed across files:

- **Single file** — all nodes in one file, linked by anchors. Good for smaller systems.
- **Multiple files** — nodes spread across files, linked by relative paths. Good for larger systems.
- Navigation links work identically either way — `[Up](#parent)` for same-file, `[Up](other-file.md#parent)` for cross-file.


## When to edit the map

The map is exempt from the active change requirement — it can be updated at any time. However:

- **Only with user engagement.** Never update the map silently or in bulk. Discuss each structural change with the user, and only update one node at a time.
- **During a change:** read the map during the Approach stage. Include map update tasks in the Plan when the mapped area is affected. If an active change already includes map tasks, mention this to the user before making additional edits.
- **Outside a change:** the user may want to restructure the map spontaneously. Support this — it is the core comprehension-building activity.


## Maintaining the map

Signals that the map needs attention:

- **A node feels like it needs sub-sections** — split into children.
- **Top-level boxes don't match the user's mental model** — restructure. The map follows the user's model, not the code's architecture.
- **A node has grown verbose** — cut aggressively. Move precision to **Detail**.
- **New concepts don't have a natural home** — the decomposition may need rethinking, not a misc section.
- **An only-child exists** — fold it into its parent.

Don't treat the map as append-only. Restructuring is not rework — it's what keeps the map useful.

**Ambiguity test.** Regularly ask whether each node in the affected area is sufficiently well characterised that a fresh agent could build from it without guessing. Flag ambiguities to the user — they are map quality issues, not implementation issues.
