# Changelog

Notable changes to NDD, newest first. The current version is the topmost heading; re-running the installer refreshes an install to the latest. Entries stay brief: the method map is where the detail lives.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-13

- Approval stamps carry a date, not a timestamp.
- Oversize nodes stamped by the session's approver are not re-flagged at review.
- *Approver* node: the handle comes from git; once a map has a stamp, every approved edit stamps.
- *Intent* is what the change must achieve, "why" goes to Context, and it is trimmed once the Approach is approved.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-13

First release of NDD, the successor to COD: the method now lives in the map, ships as a vendored `ndd/` directory via `install.py`, and carries agent rules rendered from the map, stakeholder sign-off, suggested standards and install tests.

## Predecessor: COD

The entries below are the history of COD, Comprehension-Oriented Design, from which NDD grew. Their versions are the dates of the framework snapshots that shipped under `changes/agent/`.

## 2026-06-10

- `opt-in.py`: installs can now target a subdirectory rather than always the git repository root. Run from a subdir, the script reports the repo root and the current directory and asks to confirm a subdir install (default no); declining aborts. The chosen install root gets its own self-contained `changes/` tree, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.gitignore`, so several agents can work independently in separate subdirs of one repo. Running from the repo root is unchanged and unprompted. Script `--version` bumps to 1.3.0.

## 2026-05-09.1

- `PROCESS.md`: versioning is now a Build-mode concern, not a Plan-stage one. On entering Build the agent proposes a bump kind, gets user approval, and writes the version — same flow in any mode (Formal/Explore/Wander). Every subsequent test hand-back bumps patch so the user can tell at a glance whether they are seeing the latest build. Adjacent fix: Entering build's "On Plan approval" trigger generalised to cover Wander (Intent approval).

## 2026-05-09

- `PROCESS.md`: section length triggers consolidated into a single rule and table under Plan mode. Intent and Conclusion gain 500-char triggers; Approach keeps its 1000; Conclusion in Wander gets 1000 (it carries the Approach work retrospectively). Tables and diagrams remain exempt. Same mechanism throughout — over threshold, the agent flags borderline content for the user to adjudicate.

## 2026-05-05

- `PROCESS.md`: self-prune step now applies to the Plan stage as well as the Approach — agent re-reads the Plan and applies the prune rules before surfacing.

## 2026-05-04.1

- `PROCESS.md`: change documents now declare a **Mode** under the title. **Formal** is the existing full sequence. **Explore** swaps the Plan checklist for topics + done-when. **Wander** runs Intent → Build → retrospective Conclusion with no Approach or Plan, gets topic-shift flush prompts, and is deleted (not archived) on discard. Mode is chosen after Intent (default Formal) and can be changed mid-flight by rewriting the document. Adjacent fix: blocker handling keeps `active.md` when code has been changed.

## 2026-05-04

- `PROCESS.md`: Approach gains a mandatory self-prune step before surfacing — every line must carry a decision-and-reason — and a 1000-character condense trigger that asks the user to adjudicate borderline content if exceeded (tables and diagrams exempt). Plan gains a short list of prune rules (one atomic outcome per task, no "why", no obvious sub-steps, no ceremony tasks, no redundant file paths). Several existing paragraphs across Plan mode and Build mode trimmed in the same pass.

## 2026-05-01

- `opt-in.py`: `FRAMEWORK_FILES` now includes `KEYWORDS.md` — `@`-imported by `agent/README.md` but previously not copied to consumer projects, so its `@`-import failed silently. `PRINCIPLES.md` moved out of `agent/` to the project root: it's reference material for evaluators of the framework, not part of the agent context, and doesn't ship to consumers. Top-level `README.md` gains a `Dev repo vs consumer projects` section flagging the layout asymmetry, loaded into agent context via a new `@README.md` line in this repo's `CLAUDE.md`. Existing consumer projects on a recent version need a re-run of `opt-in.py` to pick up the newly-copied `KEYWORDS.md`.

## 2026-04-28.2

- Keywords section moved out of `PROCESS.md` into a new `agent/KEYWORDS.md`. `PROCESS.md` keeps a short pointer under its own `Session keywords` heading; `agent/README.md` adds `@KEYWORDS.md` to the framework `@` pointer list. `PROCESS.md` now focuses purely on the change lifecycle.

## 2026-04-28.1

- `PROCESS.md`: Plan stage now offers two building blocks — Tasks (the existing checklist) and Topics + done-when (for exploration) — that combine as the work demands. Executing rule relaxes to "follow the Plan", ticking where tasks are present and working topics toward the done-when condition. The Plan's shape itself signals the cadence; no separate "kind" label introduced. Also dropped a stale map line that contradicted the per-node-map-edits rule.

## 2026-04-28

- `PROCESS.md`: replaced the "smallest increment" versioning rule. Plan now records the kind of bump (major/minor/patch or date-based equivalent) and Build resolves it against the current latest at start — keeps the bump correct when plans sit idle. Refinements during test bump patch; the final tested version is what ships, in a single changelog entry. Conclusion confirms or revises the bump kind if scope shifted.

## 2026-04-26.2

- `MAP-GUIDANCE.md` and `PROCESS.md`: removed pre-staging of map edits in an Approach. Map-only work happens as plan-mode per-node negotiation, exempt from the change lifecycle. For code changes, Build typically doesn't touch the map; map catch-up follows the build as a per-node negotiation, with rare tightly-bound exceptions still allowed. The Completing section now prompts the planner to flag whether the map needs catching up at hand-back time.

## 2026-04-26.1

- `README.md`: removed the per-startup `changes/agent/` version scan (step 2) — it had no anchor for which version was previously active. Replaced with a new `## On version update` section: when the user reports an update, the agent diffs `CLAUDE.md`'s `@` pointer against git history and reads the new version's `CHANGELOG.md` for migration concerns. Reactive instead of every-session.

## 2026-04-26

- `MAP-GUIDANCE.md`: new `### Root node naming` subsection establishes a convention — default to the project's name, with unambiguity as the governing rule and four resolution styles for name clashes with internal concepts.

## 2026-04-25

- `PROCESS.md` no longer hard-codes `agent/CHANGELOG.md`; refers to "the project's own changelog" and points at new `ADDITIONAL/CHANGELOG.md` (dated-`.N` or semver format options).
- `opt-in.py`: source CHANGELOG now read from repo root (was `agent/CHANGELOG.md`); install destination moves inside each version dir (`changes/agent/<version>/CHANGELOG.md`); legacy orphan at `changes/agent/CHANGELOG.md` is auto-removed on next install.

## 2026-04-24

- `PROCESS.md`: Feedback and Conclusion become post-approval summaries, drawn from a new build-time **Log** of the unexpected. The Changelog entry step folds into Completing. `README.md` startup states refreshed to match.

## 2026-04-22.5

- `PRINCIPLES.md`: **Joy** principle renamed to **Enjoyment** (Goal #2, principle section header and body, artifact-economy corollary). No change in substance — the rename softens the emotional register for better developer palatability.

## 2026-04-22.4

- `PROCESS.md`: trimmed five pieces of explanatory/disambiguation prose — user-review-rendered-file framing, "a well-constructed plan should not need close watching", the process-keyword-as-raw-material tail, and the two feedback-vs-aside disambiguation paragraphs.

## 2026-04-22.3

- `PROCESS.md`: new Build-mode paragraph requires bumping the smallest version increment whenever a build is handed to the user for review or test, so the user can visually confirm they're on the latest.

## 2026-04-22.2

- `PROCESS.md` **Approach** list gains a bullet: when a decision is fully carried by a proposed map node update, don't restate it in prose.

## 2026-04-22.1

- `MAP-GUIDANCE.md`: the only-child rule relaxed into an "only-child preference". Singleton children can remain as nodes if they represent a distinct concept or their detail would bloat the parent; the "if a sibling were added, would this still be a node?" test helps decide. The "Maintaining the map" signal updated to match.

## 2026-04-22

- `PROCESS.md` **Approach** guidance tightened: Approach is now framed as a list of decisions and their reasons, not a narrative. Added a short "what it is / isn't" list to discourage recap, file-by-file rehearsal, and subsections that don't carry a decision.

## 2026-04-19.1

- `opt-in.py` moved from `agent/opt-in.py` to the repo root. The script's internal `AGENT_DIR` was adjusted so it still finds the framework files under `agent/`. No downstream-visible effect.

## 2026-04-19

- Renamed `changes/process.md` to `changes/process-feedback.md`; file header updated to match.
- `opt-in.py` now reads the version name from the latest `## YYYY-MM-DD[.N]` heading in `agent/CHANGELOG.md` rather than computing from today's date. Every non-trivial completed change bumps the version by adding a new section at the top.
- `PROCESS.md` **Completing** section: added a Changelog entry step prompting the user on each change.
- `opt-in.py` no longer seeds a blank `changes/process-feedback.md` — the agent creates the file on first use of the `process:` keyword.

Downstream migration: after `opt-in.py` runs, any existing `changes/process.md` is left in place. Migrate entries manually with `git mv` to `changes/process-feedback.md` and delete the old file.

## 2026-04-18

Initial versioned release.

The framework introduces directory-based versioning under `changes/agent/<YYYY-MM-DD[.N]>/`. Previously, `opt-in.py` copied framework files to a single un-versioned `agent/` directory at the project root; now each install lands in a dated subdirectory and the project's `CLAUDE.md` is rewritten to point at it. Old versions are left in place so the user and agent retain direct access to prior installed state.

### Framework contents at this version

- **README.md** — startup behaviour, rules, permissions, map reference.
- **PROCESS.md** — plan/build lifecycle, Intent → Approach → Plan → Build → Archive; `process:` and `aside:` keywords.
- **STYLE.md** — coding and prose style principles.
- **MAP-GUIDANCE.md** — tree-of-nodes map format, Sync + Engagement rules, per-node pre-staging of map edits in an Approach.
- **ADDITIONAL/** — optional guides loaded on reference.

### Manual migration (from the un-versioned `agent/` layout)

After running `opt-in.py`:

- The new framework files are at `changes/agent/<YYYY-MM-DD[.N]>/`.
- `CLAUDE.md` now points at `@changes/agent/<YYYY-MM-DD[.N]>/README.md`.
- `.gitignore` has been updated to exclude `CLAUDE.md` and `changes/agent/`.
- The old `agent/` directory is left in place. Delete it manually (`rm -rf agent`) once you're satisfied the new layout works, and remove any stale `agent/` line from `.gitignore`.
